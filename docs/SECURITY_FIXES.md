# Security fixes (Session 12 — Part 1)

Running notes for the findings closed in this clone. Each entry names the
security **invariant** (Section 4 of the class notes) it restores, the
attacker role that reached it, and how the fix was verified.

Prior findings (A1 public data plane, A2 info-disclosure endpoints, A3
per-adapter Modal Sandboxes with an egress allowlist) are recorded in their
commit messages; this file starts the durable log at A4.

---

## A4 — One Secret for the whole Function (leak 1; also closes B1)

**Invariant restored:** 1 — *adapters must never see provider API keys*
(shared-process environment vector).
**Attacker role:** 3–4 — a compromised adapter / any code executing in the
gateway process (a poisoned dependency, agent-generated code, or an
SSRF→RCE foothold).

**Also closes B1.** B1 in the Section-7 in-process leak list *is* this same
vulnerability — the notes label it "env holds all keys (=A4)": all provider
keys readable from `os.environ` by any code sharing the gateway process.
The fix below is what closes it: after `keyvault.seal()`,
`os.getenv("GEMINI_API_KEY")` (and `/proc/self/environ`) no longer yield the
key in-process, so the B1 read fails too. One fix, both findings — A4 (the
Modal single-Secret shape) and B1 (the in-process env read).

**The bug.** Move 1 delivered all provider keys through a single Modal
Secret (`glc-llm-keys`) mounted on the whole gateway Function, so every key
sat in `os.environ` for the container's lifetime. Any line of in-process
code could read all seven with one call — the Section-2 theft:

```python
os.environ["GEMINI_API_KEY"]   # returns the key, and so does every other
```

**The fix (option B — vault + per-provider Secrets).**

1. `glc/security/keyvault.py` — a single narrow accessor. At gateway
   startup `glc.main`'s lifespan calls `keyvault.seal()`, which snapshots
   each provider key into a private in-process store and **deletes it from
   `os.environ`**. Afterwards `os.getenv("GEMINI_API_KEY")` is `None` and
   `/proc/self/environ` no longer carries the secret.
2. `glc/providers.py` and `glc/embedders.py` read provider keys via
   `keyvault.get(...)` instead of `os.getenv(...)` — the only legitimate
   readers, now going through one auditable chokepoint.
3. `modal_app.py` splits `glc-llm-keys` into per-provider Secrets
   (`glc-provider-gemini`, `-nvidia`, `-groq`, `-cerebras`, `-openrouter`,
   `-github`), removing the single-Secret shape and letting each key be
   scoped and rotated on its own.

**Verified.** `tests/test_a4_keyvault.py`: after `seal()`, every registered
provider key is absent from `os.environ` while `keyvault.get()` and
`build_providers()` still resolve it; non-secret config (model names, URLs)
is never scrubbed; the accessor refuses non-provider names.

**Scope / what remains.** Option B closes the "all keys resident in the
environment, forever, for everything" blast radius and the single-Secret
shape. It does not, by itself, stop *trusted* in-gateway code from calling
`keyvault.get()`. The full completion (Moves 2–4 / option A) runs each
provider call in its own short-lived Modal Sandbox that receives only that
one provider's Secret with an egress allowlist — capstone scope, mirroring
what A3 already did for channel adapters.

---

## C2 — Cross-channel envelope spoofing (leak 9)

**Invariant restored:** 2 — *every action must be checked against the
actual user, tenant, and final arguments* (here: the actual channel).
**Attacker role:** 3 — a compromised adapter holding the install token.

**The bug.** `WS /v1/channels/{name}` validated the incoming
`ChannelMessage` but never checked that `env.channel` matched the route
`{name}`. A Telegram adapter could connect to `/v1/channels/telegram` and
send an envelope with `env.channel="discord"`; every downstream check
(allowlist, owner pairing, audit) then ran against **discord**, so the
Telegram adapter borrowed Discord's trust.

**The fix.** `glc/routes/channels.py` — immediately after envelope
validation, reject any message whose `env.channel != name`: record a
`channel_spoof_rejected` audit event, send a `channel mismatch` error, and
close the socket (`WS_1008_POLICY_VIOLATION`). One deterministic
application-layer check, exactly as the notes prescribe.

**Verified.** `tests/test_c2_channel_spoof.py`: a mismatched envelope is
rejected and the socket closed; a matching envelope is not treated as a
spoof and the connection stays open.

**Also reviewed.** The `POST /v1/channels/{name}/webhook` path derives
`msg.channel` from adapter output; enforcing `msg.channel == name` there
too is a reasonable follow-up hardening, but the named leak 9 is the WS
control plane fixed here.

## A5 — Non-reproducible image (supply-chain drift)

**Invariant restored:** supports the supply-chain posture behind all eight
(a build you cannot reproduce is a build you cannot trust or audit).
**Attacker role:** supply-chain — anyone who can influence what the base
image or a dependency resolves to between builds.

**The bug.** The image was built on the rolling `debian_slim` tag with
`>=` dependency ranges (`fastapi>=0.110`, …), re-resolved on every build
and ignoring `uv.lock`. Two identical `modal deploy` runs could ship
different bytes — a new base layer or a newer transitive dependency —
so a compromised upstream release lands silently, and nothing is
auditable or reproducible.

**The fix (build from pinned inputs).**

1. `requirements.lock.txt` — the fully pinned, hash-verified export of
   `uv.lock` (`uv export --frozen --no-dev --no-emit-project`): exact `==`
   versions with `--hash=` for the whole transitive closure. `modal_app.py`
   installs from it via `.pip_install_from_requirements(...)` instead of
   `.pip_install("pkg>=x")`, so pip runs in hash-verified mode.
2. `modal_app.py` — the base image is pinned to an immutable digest,
   `python:3.11-slim-bookworm@sha256:b189929…`, via
   `Image.from_registry(...)` instead of the rolling `debian_slim`.

Because `build_image()` is reused for every A3 per-adapter Sandbox too,
both the gateway Function and every Sandbox now build from identical,
pinned inputs.

**Verified.** `requirements.lock.txt` is fully pinned + hashed (1352
lines, no unpinned specs); the base digest was resolved from the Docker
Hub registry manifest; `uv run modal deploy` rebuilds the image from the
lock + digest and the gateway boots (`/healthz` → `{"ok": true}`).

**Maintenance.** After any dependency change, regenerate the lock export
and (when bumping the base) refresh the digest — both commands are in the
`modal_app.py` header comment.

## A6 — Audit db on a Volume with autoscale (concurrent writers + durability)

**Invariant restored:** 7 — *components must not be able to corrupt the
audit log* (here: the deployment must not corrupt it either).
**Attacker role:** availability / integrity — triggered by load, not a
specific actor: enough traffic makes autoscale spin up a second writer.

**The bug.** The audit / pairing / cost databases are SQLite files on the
shared Modal Volume. SQLite is single-writer and a Volume is not a
concurrent-write filesystem, yet the gateway ran with `min_containers=0`
and no upper bound — so under load Modal could run two containers, both
writing `audit.sqlite`, corrupting or splitting the trail. Separately, a
write to a Volume mount is not durable until the Volume is committed, and
the app never committed — so on scale-to-zero the newest audit rows could
vanish.

**The fix (single writer + explicit durability).**

1. `modal_app.py` — `max_containers=1` on the gateway Function. With
   `min=0 / max=1` there are only ever 0 or 1 writers, never two, so the
   concurrent-writer corruption cannot happen (this also protects the
   pairing and cost SQLite files on the same Volume).
2. `glc/audit/store.py` — a `set_commit_hook()` seam; `AuditStore.append()`
   flushes via the hook after every insert. `modal_app.py` registers
   `data_volume.commit`, so each audit row is persisted all the way to the
   Volume and survives shutdown / scale-to-zero. The hook is best-effort
   (a commit hiccup never fails the request or blocks auditing) and unset
   off Modal, where SQLite autocommit is already durable. `reload()` is
   unnecessary under `max_containers=1` — no other writer can advance the
   Volume behind the single container.

The store remains append-only at the app layer (no update/delete/clear
methods) — invariant 7.

**Verified.** `tests/test_a6_audit_durability.py`: append invokes the
commit hook exactly once; append still works with no hook; a failing hook
never breaks append and the row still lands; the store exposes no
delete/update/clear. Full suite 285 passed. Live: `uv run modal deploy`
with `max_containers=1` boots (`/healthz` → `{"ok": true}`).

**Scope / related.** The OS-layer writability of the SQLite files from
in-process code (leak 2 / B2: `DELETE FROM audit_log`) is a separate
finding — closed by component separation + a hash-chained append-only log,
tracked elsewhere. A6 is the deployment-level concurrency + durability of
the audit db, fixed here.

## B7 — Cost-ledger poisoning (leak 10)

**Invariant restored:** 8 — *every run must have hard limits on time,
tokens, tool calls, and cost*. A budget is only as trustworthy as the
ledger it is measured from; a ledger anyone can forge enforces nothing.
**Attacker role:** 3–4 — any code sharing the gateway process.

**The bug.** `glc.db.log_call()` wrote whatever the caller handed it and
validated nothing, so in-process code could forge rows in the ledger that
`/v1/cost/by_agent`, `recent()` and `aggregate()` report from:

```python
glc.db.log_call(provider="gemini", model="x",
                input_tokens=999_999_999, agent="victim", status="ok")
```

Three concrete harms:
* **absurd counters** inflate a victim's apparent spend (the notes' exploit);
* **negative counters** are worse — they *shrink* the `SUM()` in
  `by_agent()`/`aggregate()`, so an attacker can **mask** real spend rather
  than merely fake it;
* **non-integer values** slide straight into an `INTEGER` column (SQLite is
  dynamically typed), corrupting every later `SUM`/`AVG` over it.

**The fix.** `glc/db.py` validates every field at the single write
chokepoint before it reaches the ledger:
* each counter must be a **non-negative whole number within a ceiling** set
  far above any real call (`MAX_TOKENS` 10M vs. ~2M largest real context;
  `MAX_LATENCY_MS` 24h);
* text fields are **length-bounded** (`MAX_TEXT_LEN`) so a caller cannot
  fill the ledger/Volume with giant blobs;
* `provider` / `model` are required and non-empty.

A bad row is **refused** (`LedgerValueError`), not clamped — clamping would
still record the attacker's fiction, just a smaller one. `None` counters
still coerce to `0` because the real callers pass
`result.get("input_tokens", 0)`, which can be `None`.

**Verified.** `tests/test_b7_ledger_validation.py` (10 tests): the absurd,
negative, non-integer and bool counters are all refused and nothing is
written; realistic rows still land; `None`→0 and nullable `embed_dim`
preserved; oversized text bounded; and a refused poisoning attempt leaves
`by_agent()` totals intact. Full suite 295 passed — all 11 legitimate
`log_call` sites in `glc/routes/chat.py` unaffected.

**Honest scope.** This does **not** stop a caller writing *plausible* fake
rows, or attributing a genuine call to another agent — those numbers pass
every check here. Closing that needs a signed writer the gateway alone
holds, plus process separation (capstone scope, same root cause as B5/B6:
one process, no walls).

## B2 — Audit db writable at the OS layer (leak 2)

**Invariant restored:** 7 — *components must not be able to edit or delete
their own audit logs*.
**Attacker role:** 3–4 — any code sharing the gateway process.

**The bug.** The application layer exposed only `append()` — no update, no
delete — but that is a promise made in Python, not one the filesystem
enforces. The audit db is a plain SQLite file, writable by anything running
as the same user, which is every adapter:

```python
sqlite3.connect("~/.glc/audit.sqlite").execute("DELETE FROM audit_log")
```

The security history is gone, silently, with nothing left to show it ever
existed.

**The fix (tamper-evident hash chain + anchor).** Schema **v1 → v2**:

1. `glc/audit/schema.sql` — `audit_log` gains `prev_hash` / `row_hash`, and
   a new one-row `audit_chain_head` table anchors the expected head hash and
   row count.
2. `glc/audit/store.py` — `append()` now reads the head, computes
   `row_hash = sha256(prev_hash + every field of the row)`, inserts the
   chained row and advances the anchor — all inside one `BEGIN IMMEDIATE`
   transaction under a process lock, so the anchor can never drift from the
   table or fork under concurrent appends.
3. `verify_chain()` recomputes the whole chain and reports precisely what
   went wrong: `row_modified`, `chain_broken`, `rows_missing`,
   `head_mismatch`, or `table_missing`.
4. `_migrate()` ALTERs a live v1 `audit_log` up to v2 (`CREATE TABLE IF NOT
   EXISTS` cannot add columns to an existing table). Pre-migration rows keep
   NULL hashes and are reported as `legacy_rows` — unverifiable, but not
   mistaken for tampering.

**Why the anchor matters.** A hash chain *inside* the table cannot detect a
wholesale `DELETE FROM audit_log` — an empty table chains vacuously. The
anchor is what catches it: the rows are gone, but the head still remembers
how many there should have been.

**Verified.** `tests/test_b2_audit_chain.py` (13 tests) drives the real
exploit — raw `sqlite3.connect()` against the same file, exactly as leak 2
does — and asserts detection of: the wholesale `DELETE` (the named exploit),
a single-row deletion, an in-place row modification, tail truncation, a
`DROP TABLE`, and a forged row inserted without extending the chain. Plus
the honest path (chain verifies, rows link, `query()` unaffected) and the
v1→v2 migration. Full suite 308 passed.

**Honest scope.** This makes tampering **detectable, not impossible**. The
hash is unkeyed and the anchor lives in the same file, so in-process code
can still delete rows *and* recompute the chain and anchor to match. What it
closes is the naive erase the finding names, and it makes any tampering that
does not also forge the chain loudly visible. Tamper-*proof* needs the
writer in its own process holding a key the caller cannot reach, or an
external anchor — same root cause as B5/B6.

## B4 — Install token readable in-process (leak 4)

**Invariant restored:** supports 1/2 — the control token is the operator's
identity; anything holding it can act as the operator.
**Attacker role:** 3–4 — any code sharing the gateway process.

**The bug.** The per-installation control token sat on disk in **plaintext**
at `~/.glc/install_token`, mode `0600`. Mode `0600` keeps other *Unix users*
out — it does nothing about other *code running as the same user*, which is
every adapter in the gateway process:

```python
tok = open(os.path.expanduser("~/.glc/install_token")).read().strip()
```

One line, and the caller holds the operator's credential.

**The fix (store a verifier, not a secret).** The gateway never needs to
*recover* the token — only to *verify* a presented one. So only
`sha256(token)` is kept, on disk and in memory. Reading the file now yields a
hash, which is useless as a bearer credential.

`glc/config.py` resolves the token once at boot via `seal_install_token()`,
from, in priority order:
1. **`GLC_INSTALL_TOKEN`** (env / Modal Secret) — the operator picks it, so
   they already know it and nothing ever has to hand it back. Scrubbed from
   `os.environ` on seal, so `os.getenv()` is closed too (same move as A4).
2. **A legacy plaintext file** — hashed **in place** on first boot, so an
   existing installation's token keeps working while the plaintext leaves
   disk.
3. **Freshly generated** — returned exactly once so the operator can record
   it; only the hash is retained.

Verification uses `hmac.compare_digest`, so the check is also no longer a
**timing oracle** (Category 11) that could leak the token a character at a
time. `glc token --rotate` mints a new token if the operator loses theirs.
Consumers that used to *steal* the token from disk — the twilio_sms webhook
and the telegram/discord dev bridges — are now *given* one via
`GLC_INSTALL_TOKEN`, which is what an adapter should always have done.

**Verified.** `tests/test_b4_install_token.py` (11 tests): the disk holds a
hash not the token, and presenting that stolen hash to the data plane and the
WS route both fail (403 / socket closed) — the end-to-end version of leak 4;
the env var is scrubbed after seal; a legacy plaintext file migrates in place
with the old token still valid; fresh install shows the token once and never
persists it; rotation invalidates the old token. Full suite 319 passed.

**Honest scope.** Verification-only storage means there is no on-disk or
in-environment copy to steal. It does not stop in-process code from reading a
token off a request in flight, or from using `verify_install_token()` as an
oracle (guessing a 256-bit token is infeasible). Binding the token to the
gateway alone is, as the notes say, ultimately process separation.

**⚠ Deployment note.** `modal_app.py` now attaches a `glc-install-token`
Secret. Create it before the next deploy:
```
uv run modal secret create glc-install-token GLC_INSTALL_TOKEN=<pick-a-strong-value>
```
If you instead let the existing Volume token migrate, **save your current
token first** — after the migration it is a hash and cannot be recovered
(recover by rotating).
